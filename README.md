History
-------

Microgravity was started in 2013 and open-sourced in 2016. It provided the test bed for Artsy's [isomorphic JavaScript applications, rendering both the server and client side](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/11/30/rendering-on-the-server-and-client-in-node-dot-js).

In 2017, microgravity [was merged into Force](https://github.com/artsy/force/pull/890) effectively deprecating this repo.
